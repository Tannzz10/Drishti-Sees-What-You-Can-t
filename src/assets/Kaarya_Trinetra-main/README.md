# 🏗️ AI-Powered Construction Site Analysis (In Progress)

An intelligent construction monitoring system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze and classify construction stages from images, paired with geolocation tracking and 3D modeling dashboards for real-time project oversight.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📷 **CNN-based Stage Detection**: Identifies and classifies construction progress (e.g., Foundation, Framing, Finishing).
- 🌍 **Geolocation Tagging**: Automatically logs site coordinates with each image capture or upload.
- 🧱 **3D Modeling Dashboard**: Visual representation of project development using real-time modeling tools.
- 📊 **Progress Analytics**: Insightful charts and stage-wise completion indicators.
- ☁️ **Deployed on Netlify** for quick accessibility and modern UI presentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (CNN Models)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **APIs**: Geolocation API, Cloud APIs (optional for image hosting)
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js / WebGL (planned)
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a construction image.
2. The backend (CNN model) classifies the image into a specific construction stage.
3. The frontend tags the image with its geolocation and sends it to the dashboard.
4. Progress is visualized on a 3D timeline and map-based interface.
